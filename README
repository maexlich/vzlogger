This is a fork of the original vzlogger with Modbus support for tracking variables of house controllers.
It is adapted to a very specific use case and has been disconnected from the upstream vzlogger for a long time.
Thus, it might be of use if somebody wants to implement something similar in the current version of vzlogger,
but should not be used in production.

vzlogger...
  * is a tool to read and log measurements of a wide variety of smartmeters, sensors to the volkszaehler.org middleware.
  * can run as a daemon or via Cron.
  * includes a tiny onboard httpd to serve realtime readings to the AJAX web frontend.
  * is written in ANSI C and should run on most embedded devices which conform to the POSIX standard.

Feel free to implement support your own hardware ;)
